### Introduction

> I miss the old Kanye... 
> - Kanye West (2016)

But who, what & when is this old Kanye? Is it possible to uncover who the old Kanye is by analyzing his music. Are there any significant differences in his earlier and later works, and is there a way to cluster these works so we have an old Kanye and a new Kanye. 

### Corpus
The corpus used for this research consists of the 9 studio albums released by Kanye West. His collaborative studio albums will be excluded. Any non-musical tracks featured on the albums will be included, e.g. skits.
